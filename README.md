✨ **Features**

- ✔ Beautiful & Responsive UI — Built with TailwindCSS & DaisyUI for a clean and modern look.
- 🖍 Syntax Highlighting — Automatic formatting with HighlightJS.
- 📝 Markdown Rendering — Automatic formatting with Marked.
- ⏳ Configurable Expiry — Set custom expiration times with API.
- 🔒 Secure & Private — Client-side encryption with WebCrypto API for encrypted pastes. No password saved in server.
- 📡 Powerful API — Create and fetch pastes without leaving the terminal.
- 🔍 Public Pastes — List & search all public pastes.
- 🔑 Private Pastes — Only accessible via a unique, unguessable link for enhanced privacy (use encryption on web UI for ultimate privacy).
- 🗄 Local Storage — Uses SQLite for a lightweight, self-hostable database.
- 👤 User Accounts — Create & manage your pastes with authentication.
- 🔗 Easy Sharing — Share paste links or scan a QR code for instant access.
- 🛡 Built-in Rate Limiting — Protects against spam and abuse with smart request throttling.
- 🐳 Easy self-host with docker.
- 🌍 Multi-arch multi-platform builds. Support for AMD64, ARM64 on *Windows(*AMD64 only), Linux and MacOS.
- 📦 `Standalone` binary will run `frontend` (client) if project's `public` folder exists in same directory. Otherwise the `API` just works!
- 🧰 `Non-standalone` (`chiyogami`) runs the `full-featured` `self-contained` binary.



## Installation
Docker. Build it or check [docker-compose](https://github.com/rhee876527/chiyogami/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file for example with pre-built images.

Releases contain 2 variants of portable go builds: `chiyogami-*` and `chiyogami-standalone-*` both of which will serve the frontend client and API or just the API respectively.

### Quick run

```
 docker run -d \
  -v "$(pwd)/pastes:/pastes" \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000 \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/rhee876527/chiyogami:latest
```

| PORT | None | Customize default port. Ignored in Docker build. |

#### Note about exposing /health to public
Since v1.4.3 this `healthcheck` endpoint was created to actively monitor state of application's database. It has potential for abuse WHEN exposed publicly. Caution is hereby given to protect endpoint (http://localhost:8000/health) from external access as necessary.

If using `Traefik` as reverse proxy this can be done in the `docker-compose` file by adding the following middleware:
```
...
services:
  chiyogami:
    labels:
      - "traefik.http.routers.chiyogami.middlewares=localonly-health"
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.localonly-health.replacepathregex.regex=^/health$"
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.localonly-health.replacepathregex.replacement=/nonexistent-path"
...
```

## Usage
Web UI is simple & straightforward. Or use the `API`.

#### Create paste
***FILE***
```
curl http://localhost:8000/paste -T sample.txt
```
or **JSON**
```
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8000/paste \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"content":"Test paste"}'
```




**response:** `{"title":"OkxI"}`




Note: Pastes are created by default with `Public` `visibility`. They can be accessed from api or website.
Change this to `Private` or `Unlisted` to make the paste undiscoverable. Pastes are also set to expire within 24hrs if expiry is not specified.

You can set a default expiry for new pastes with `PASTE_DEFAULT_EXPIRATION`.




#### Create private paste with 48h expiry

```
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8000/paste \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"content":"Test", "visibility":"Private", "expiration":"48h"}'
```
**response:** `{"title":"euVa"}`




#### Fetch created paste
```
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/paste/bZTR -H "Accept: application/json"
```



**response:**
``
{"ID":22,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-04T19:48:06.747679947Z","UpdatedAt":"2025-02-04T19:48:06.747679947Z","DeletedAt":null,"Title":"bZTR","Content":"test private","Visibility":"Private","Expiration":"2025-02-05T19:48:06.747635027Z","IsEncrypted":false,"UserID":0,"IsUserPaste":false}
